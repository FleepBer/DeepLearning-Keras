In this model, the clothes dataset (MNIST Fashion) was used for classification and identification of clothes categories. Using Keras from Tensorflow to train deep learning models, decreasing the error rate.

# Model creation

- [x] Flatten (image size per pixel);
- [x] Dense (density capacity level);
- [x] ReLU - rectified linear unit;
- [x] Softmax - normalized exponential function;
- [x] Dropout (20% dormancy for Neurons).

# Model validation
- [x] Display of the hit rate (accuracy);
- [x] Validation by season (epochs);
- [x] Split validation (verification rate to measure hit= 0.2).

# Visualization 
- [x] hit rate per season ('acc' and 'val_acc');
- [x] display of epochal losses ('loss' and 'val_loss');
- [x] plot (graphical view).

Model test for final validation
- [x] Predictive model.
 - argmax (points or elements of the domain of some function in which the values of the function are maximized).
